# ==========
# - All strings have to be enquoted. Use \" for quotes inside the strings.
# - Numbers can also be specified in hexadecimal format, prefixed with 0x.
# - If a multi-language string (without "_jp") would be the same in both languages, you can only specify <keyname> without a language suffix (like "<keyname>_en").
#   The string will then be used for both languages.
